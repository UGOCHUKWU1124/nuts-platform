  - You are about to alter the column `code` on the `discount_codes` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(50)`.
  - You are about to alter the column `description` on the `discount_codes` table. The data in that column could be lost. The data in that column will be cast from `Text` to `VarChar(500)`.
  - Made the column `minOrderAmount` on table `discount_codes` required. This step will fail if there are existing NULL values in that column.
